## Abstract
In 3-4 sentences, concisely describe:

What problem your project addresses.
The overall approach you will use to solve the problem.
How you propose to evaluate your success against your stated goals.

We are hoping to create a algorithm that looks at NFL players performance and predicts their performance for the following year. By doing so, we will be able to create a ranking that can be used to predict Fantasy Football Performance. We will evaluate the effectiveness of our model by running it against previous years and seeing how it performed predicting player performance vs how they actually performed that year.

## Motivation and Question
Describe your motivation for your project idea. Some (shortened) examples of good types of motivations:

We have a scientific data set for which predictive or expoloratory models would help us generate hypotheses.
We have user information for which predictive models would help us give users better experiences.
We have performance data (e.g. from sports teams) for which predictive models could help us make better decisions.
Algorithmic bias is an increasingly urgent challenge as machine learning products proliferate, and we want to explore it more deeply.
You should be more specific than these: describe your specific data set (if applicable); your scientific questions; the type of decisions your model could inform; etc.

We are all very interested in the intersection between sports and statistics. Football is a sport where statistics are tracked frequently and there are many available. We are hoping to find which statistics and variables are more significant in determining a players performance year to year. Fantasy Football is played by millions of people all over the world and an effective algorithm would be helpful to all players.

## Planned Deliverables
Concisely state what you are aiming to create and what capabilities it will have. For most projects, I would expect the deliverable to include:

A Python package containing all code used for algorithms and analysis, including documentation.
At least one Jupyter notebook illustrating the use of the package to analyze data.
However, your specific idea might imply different deliverables (e.g. an essay). Consult with me if you’re not sure.

You should describe what your deliverable will be able to do and how you will evaluate its effectiveness. Please consider two scenarios:

“Full success.” What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan?
“Partial success.” What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don’t 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren’t able to get that webapp together, but you can still create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline needed to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!

We are hoping to deliver a Python package containing all code we will use for our algorithm and a Jupyter notebook where analysis and performance is examined. We will need to extensively clean our data and ensure the data set we are looking at has all variables we are hoping to look at. If our model proves to be ineffective, at least we will be able to determine which statistics are not helpful in predicting performance year to year.

## Written Deliverables
You’ll also write a blog post on your project; you don’t have to discuss this post in your proposal though.

## Resources Required
What resources do you need in order to complete your project? Data? Computing power? An account with a specific service?

Please pay special attention to the question of data. If your project idea involves data, include at least one link to a data set you can use. If you can’t find data for your original idea, that’s ok! Think of something related to your group’s interests for which you can find data.

Most projects should involve data in some way, but certain projects may not require data. Ask me if you’re not sure.

## What You Will Learn
Each group member should return to their stated goals from the reflective goal-setting assignment at the beginning of the course. Then, in this section, please state what each group member intends to learn through working on the project, relating your intentions to your stated goals. You might be thinking of certain algorithms, software packages, version control, project management, effective teamwork, etc.

## Risk Statement
What are two things that could potentially stop you from achieving the full deliverable above? Maybe it turns out that the pattern you thought would be present in the data just doesn’t exist? Or maybe your idea requires more computational power than is available to you? What particular risks might be applicable for your project?

## Ethics Statement
All projects we undertake involve decisions about whose interests matter; which problems are important; and which tradeoffs are considered acceptable. Take some time to reflect on the potential impacts of your project on its prospective users and the broader world. Address the following questions:

What groups of people have the potential to benefit from our project?
What groups of people have the potential to be excluded from benefit or even harmed from our project?
Will the world become an overall better place because we made our project? Describe at least 2 assumptions behind your answer. For example, if your project aims to make it easier to predict crime, your assumptions might include:
Criminal activity is predictable based on other features of a person or location.
The world is a better place when police are able to perform their roles more efficiently.
If your project involves making decisions or recommendations, then you will also need to consider possible forms of algorithmic bias in your work. Here are some relevant examples:

A recipe recommendation app can privilege the cuisines of some locales over others. Will your user search recipes by ingredients? Peanut butter and tomato might seem an odd combination in the context of European cuisine, but is common in many traditional dishes of the African diaspora. A similar set of questions applies to recommendation systems related to style or beauty.
A sentiment analyzer must be trained on specific languages. What languages will be included? Will diverse dialects be included, or only the “standard” version of the target language? Who would be excluded by such a choice, and how will you communicate about your limitations?

## Tentative Timeline
We will have a checkpoint for the project in Week 9 or 10, and then final presentations in Week 12. With this in mind, please describe what you expect to achieve after three and six. Your goal by the three-week check-in should be to have “something that works.” For example, maybe in three weeks you’ll ready to demonstrate the data acquisition pipeline and show some exploratory analysis, and in the last couple weeks you’ll actually implement your machine learning models.
